1. Description of Files
	1. Project3.java - Reads data from file, stores into prelimary data structures, and runs algorithms
	2. Algorithms.java - Contians logic and code for RR (q=1), SRT, and FB (q=1, 3 queues) algorithms
	3. Project3Summary.docx - Summary of the project
	4. readme.txt - information about files and instructions on how to run file(s)
	
2. How to Compile Project (all done in Windows terminal, but can be done in CS1 Linux server also)
	- If using Windows terminal
		1. Open Windows terminal
		2. Make sure all files listed in "Description of Files" above and all test files are in same file location and in the same folder (if not, create folder to put all files into)
		3. Compile Project3 - javac Project3.java
		4. Execute Project3 - java Project3 SRT ("SRT" can instead be "RR", "FB", or "ALL" for all 3)
	- If using CS1 Linux Server
		1. Connect using GlobalProtect
		2. Open an SSH client (I used XShell)
		3. Open session and establish connection 
		4. Make sure all files listed in "Description of Files" above and all test files are in the same directory (if not, create a directory where all files can be put in)
		5. Compile Project3 - javac Memory.java
		6. Execute Project3 - java Project3 SRT ("SRT" can instead be "RR", "FB", or "ALL" for all 3)
